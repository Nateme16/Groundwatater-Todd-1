Contact: Nate Merrill, merrill.nathaniel@epa.gov

####This file package was used to make the results of the paper listed above. It contains the following files and folders:

> - **AJAErun.m** - the primary program file
> - **AJAErun_tab.m**  - for creating Table 4 in the paper
> - **conevolume.m** - calculates the volume of water given the cone parameters
> - **conevolume2.m** - returns the surface area of a cone of a given volume and height
> - **eom2.m** - the equation of motion for groundwater height
> - **irrig.m** - translates groundwater height to remaining irrigated acres
> - **raintime.m** - calculates rainfall probabilities based on MC process
> - **profit and crop yields** - folder containing profit and crop yield functions
> - **randp** - file package for creating MC rainfall time series from discrete rainfall levels
> - **value function iteration** - file package for solving the various rainfall scenarios using stochastic dynamic programming and value function iteration.
